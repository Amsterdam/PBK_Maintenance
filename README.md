# MODCMAC
This repository contains the code for Multi-Objective Deep Centralized Multi-Agent Actor Critic (MODCMAC) algorithm. 
The algorithm is implemented in PyTorch and builds upon the work of Jesse van Remmerden found [here](https://github.com/jesserem/MODCMAC).
## Installation
The dependencies can be installed using the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Running the code
The code can be run using the following command:
```
python run_MODCMAC.py [args]
```
The function of each argument can be found by running:
```
python run_MODCMAC.py --help
```
## Disclaimer
The code is a work in progress and is not yet complete.
